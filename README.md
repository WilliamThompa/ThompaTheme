# Thompa - VS Code Theme

I made this as a small project because I didn't find a theme that matched what I was looking for. I wanted a theme that uses dark blues, with green and yellow.

This theme takes some inspiration from colours that might be found in a forest at night. I hope that you like the theme I've created.

Feel Free to make your own versions of my theme. I have included a license. 

Thank you for using my theme!
